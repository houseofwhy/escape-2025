# Escape from 2024!
This is a small escape-room-like quest we made to celebrate New Year 2025.

### Preamble
Once you start the game, you will find yourself in a dungeon of a small castle. You don’t remember how you got there. Something strange is going on...

Your goal is to escape from the dungeon and from the castle.

### Starting conditions
You should start inside a small Christmas-looking house.

If not, `/tp @a 246 66 -396`

### Attention!
There is no ‘reset’ for this level. If you want to play it again, download another clean copy.

### Hints
* There are many hints, usually in form of books. Sometimes in form of signs.
* However, it is possible to solve every puzzle without looking into the books.
* Every room in the castle and in the castle yard holds a secret. It is either a piece of a puzzle, an item, or a book with a hint.

### Settings
* Game mode: Adventure
* Difficulty: Easy or Hard (there will be hostiles!)
* Singleplayer-focused, but will work in multiplayer setting.
